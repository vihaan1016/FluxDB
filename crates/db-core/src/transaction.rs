//! MVCC transaction primitives — snapshot-based visibility and conflict detection.
//!
//! Every read and write in the B+Tree operates against a [`Transaction`] that
//! bundles the transaction's identity (`txn_id`) with its point-in-time view
//! of the database ([`Snapshot`]). This ensures consistent visibility: a
//! transaction sees exactly the data that was committed before its snapshot
//! was taken, and nothing from in-progress or future transactions.
//!
//! ## Visibility Rule (PostgreSQL Semantics)
//!
//! A record with `(xmin, xmax)` is visible to a transaction holding `snap` if:
//!
//! 1. The creating transaction (`xmin`) is committed from `snap`'s perspective.
//! 2. The record has not been deleted/replaced (`xmax == 0`), OR the deleting
//!    transaction (`xmax`) has NOT committed from `snap`'s perspective.
//!
//! ## Conflict Detection (First-Writer-Wins)
//!
//! Before modifying a record (setting its `xmax`), the caller must check that
//! no other in-progress transaction has already claimed it. If `xmax` is set
//! by an active transaction, the current transaction loses (returns
//! `WriteConflict`). The first transaction to set `xmax` wins.
